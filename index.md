## Resources for Learning Data Science

### Recommended Data Set

A Data Set from the [awesome-datascience](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience) GitHub "Data Sets" list that interested me was the [Heart failure clinical records Data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records) from the UC Irvince Machine Learning Repository.

The data set consists of medical records from patients who had heart failure, that were collected during their follow-up period. Attributes collected from these medical records can help identify patterns and correlations associated with heart failure. By identifying the most significant features or characteristics associated with heart failure one can target patients with similar traits and try to address these health issues early on.


### Data Science book

[R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund is a book listed on the [free-data-science-book](https://github.com/chaconnewu/free-data-science-books) GitHub that interested me.

R is a very important programming language in the field of data science due to it's emphasis in statistical computing, and crucial to learn as a Big Data Analytics student. What interests me the most about this book is that is teaches you how to analyze data in R from a beginner level.
